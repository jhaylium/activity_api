# METADATA Activity.py
## This is the code for our metadata api which tracks all user and worker activity.
## The api is currently deployed to an AWS SPOT Instance hopefully saving us money for a more powerful machine
## The API is built on FASTAPI as a POC/Prod workload to test its performance against our flask data api
